# Compilation of learning ressources and libraries for private and secure IA

We provide here a first non-exhaustive list of learning ressources and libraries for **private and secure IA** applications. **Differential privacy, federated learning and fully homomorphic encryption** are covered. We will be populating it in the next months with regular updates. You may follow us in Twitter for further news: https://twitter.com/AntonioRausell

============================================
## State-of-the-art machine learning libraries for private IA from two main programing ecosystems:

### PySyft-based ecosystem for private IA:

- **PySyft** : https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/
is a Python library for secure and private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Encrypted Computation (like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and  Homomorphic Encryption (HE) within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. See video tutorials therein

- **Diffprivlib v0.3**: https://github.com/IBM/differential-privacy-library
Diffprivlib is a general-purpose library for experimenting with, investigating and developing applications in differential privacy.

### TensorFlow-based ecosystem for private IA:

- **TensorFlow Privacy**: https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy
Python library that includes implementations of TensorFlow optimizers for training machine learning models with differential privacy. The library comes with tutorials and analysis tools for computing the privacy guarantees provided.

- **TensorFlow Federated** (Machine Learning on Decentralized Data):https://www.tensorflow.org/federated
Tutorials on federated learning usingTensorFlow : https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification

- **TF Encrypted**: https://github.com/tf-encrypted/tf-encrypted
is a framework for encrypted machine learning in TensorFlow. It looks and feels like TensorFlow, taking advantage of the ease-of-use of the Keras API while enabling training and prediction over encrypted data via secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption. TF Encrypted aims to make privacy-preserving machine learning readily available, without requiring expertise in cryptography, distributed systems, or high performance computing.
